# PROJECT 2

# DESCRIPTION

This project is designed to read various types of CSV files, generate graphs based on the data, and analyze the visualizations using an LLM. It has been tested with three CSV files, and for each file, a corresponding folder is created. The graphs generated for each CSV file are stored in their respective folders.

# HIGHLIGHTS

* Required files are given in meta data as requires and dependencies. So no need to install each time in pip command.
